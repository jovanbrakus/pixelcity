# Pixel City #

A screensaver for Windows which generates and performs a fly-through of a nighttime cityscape.

  * There are no art assets.  All content is generated at runtime.
  * Aimed at older graphics hardware. The goal is for the program to perform acceptably on machines "five years old or less".
  * Written in C++ using OpenGL. No fragment or vertex shaders are used.
